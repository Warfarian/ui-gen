Okay cool, You dont have to give back the "Generated Design" tree, that is only for feeding into the llama ai. 

Workflow is like this: user input -> send to the magic loops api -> receive the tree -> send that into the llama ai -> llama will give the code by using the parse tree while also using its prompt which I have already defined in the index.js file -> The code will be viewable if users click the view code button, but the design has to be visible (ie) render the html css to show the final design.

We need to render the html and css in the same window, and show the user the design.
